# Youtube-SentimentAnalysis

What Happens When You Run the Code:
1. The user enters a YouTube video ID into the text box.
2. The app fetches the transcript of the video.
3. Each line of the transcript is analyzed for sentiment (positive or negative).
4. The app displays the sentiment for each line along with a summary of how many lines were positive and how many were negative, including their percentages.
5. The user can see a detailed breakdown of the transcriptâ€™s sentiment and the overall trend (more positive or more negative).
